<h1>The Best Movies According to Oge</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<h3>The Originals</h3>
<p>The Originals are a group of extremely powerful vampires that are first generation of vampires and progemitors of their respective bloodlines.They are the oldest, fastest, strongest and mot powerful vampires in the world.<br />I love that it centres on family drama.I love the storyline, the characters, the everything. And ofcourse Klaus Michealson is my favorite character.

<h3>Bridgerton</h3>
<p>Only because i loveeeee romance and this movie fuels my delusion.The lead actors are absolutely gorgeous and their love confessions makes me want to fall in love.</p>

<h3>Alchemy Of Souls</h3>
<p>A must-watch K-drama.Brilliant storyline.The cast has great synergy, and you could feel it in every scene.It also has the right amount of humor.</p>
